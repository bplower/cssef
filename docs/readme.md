# Documentation setup

## Build Dependencies
Sphinx documentation generation is done via Make. You will need sphinx and sphinx_rtd_theme installed:
```
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

It is suggested that you install sphinx-autobuild to make documentation improvements easier to check locally.
```
pip install sphinx-autobuild
```
