## Description
The Cyber Security Scoring Engine Framework (CSSEF) is an easy to use framework for hosting security competitions. The primary purpose of the framework has been to make scoring security competitions as simple as possible, so that more time and energy may be spent setting up the competition environment itself. Many of the features and requirements were determined by the competitions hosted in house by the University of Alaskaâ€™s Cyber Security Club, which attended the National Cyber Collegiate Defense Competition several years in a row. While initial development focused on providing utilities for CCDC-like competitions, the project expanded to facilitate other types of competitions as well, such as capture the flag events..
